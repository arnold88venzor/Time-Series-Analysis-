# Time-Series-Analysis-
In the following assignment time series analysis was used to understand the future value of 
the Japanese yen in contrast to the U.S. dollar. Time series forecasting as well as linear regression modeling was used to predict these future movements. 
Regression analysis- Historical daily yen futures data was used to determine any predictable behaviors. Initially I plotted the ‘settle’ price from going back to early 1990’s. Then decomposition was carried out my means of the Hodrick-Prescott Filter into two separate series: noise and trend. The ARMA model was then utilized to forecast returns, ARIMA model used to forecast price and GARCH was used to forecast  volatility. 
These models revealed the yen price would fall versus the U.S. dollar and give way to an increase in volatility.  
I believe the models serve as a fundamental basis indicative of investment in yen may be greater in risk than in reward. 
A linear regression model was used to forecast returns of the yen using the in sample and out of sample
determining accuracy of time series model. I conclude the model may serve to accurately forecast out of sample.
